# Wes Roth OpenClaw Analysis

Wes Roth approaches OpenClaw (and AI agents generally) from a **strategic, "Future of Work" perspective**, contrasting with Julian Goldie's tactical/SEO focus.

## Core Insights

### 1. The Shift to "Agentic" Workflows
Wes often highlights OpenClaw as a prime example of the industry shifting from "Chatbots" (ChatGPT) to "Agents" (software that *does* things).
*   **Key Takeaway**: Don't just use it to write text. Use it to **execute** processes that usually require human glue (e.g., "Take data from email -> put in spreadsheet -> email boss").

### 2. Open Source vs. Closed Ecosystems
Wes is a strong proponent of open-source tools.
*   **Insight**: He favors OpenClaw because it's local/open, unlike OpenAI's "GPTs" which are locked into the ChatGPT ecosystem. This gives you control over the data and the "brains".

### 3. The "Blue Collar" AI
While Julian focuses on SEO, Wes often discusses agents replacing "digital manual labor".
*   **Use Case**: Data entry, formatting, file organization.
*   **Recommendation**: Use OpenClaw for the boring, repetitive admin tasks that burn human energy.
