# OpenClaw Workflows (Julian Goldie Style)

Julian Goldie and the community focus on "high leverage" tasks that replace human VA work.

## 1. The "Researcher" Workflow

**Goal:** Automate deep research while you sleep.

**Trigger:** Message via WhatsApp/Telegram.
> "Research the top 5 competitors for [keyword] and summarize their content gaps."

**Process:**
1.  Agent uses browser tool to visit competitor sites.
2.  Agent reads content (text extraction).
3.  Agent synthesizes a report.
4.  Agent sends the report back to you or saves it to a Google Doc (if configured).

## 2. The "Content Factory" Workflow

**Goal:** Repurpose content across platforms.

**Trigger:** Upload a video file or transcript path.
> "Take this YouTube transcript, clean it up, and generate 5 Twitter threads and a LinkedIn post."

**Process:**
1.  Agent reads the file.
2.  Agent applies specific style guidelines (system prompt).
3.  Agent outputs the formatted posts.

## 3. The "Personal Admin" (The Car Buying Example)

*cited from viral examples shared by Julian*

**Goal:** Complex, multi-step real-world interaction.
**Prompt:** "Find me a Hyundai Palisade Hybrid within 50 miles... contact dealers for best price."

**Process:**
1.  **Market Research:** Agent searches Reddit/Forums for "fair price" benchmarks.
2.  **Inventory Search:** Agent uses browser to check dealer inventories.
3.  **Action:** Agent fills out contact forms on dealer websites.

## 4. SEO Automation (Julian's Specialty)

**Goal:** Programmatic SEO tasks.

*   **Keyword Analysis:** "Check these 50 keywords in Ahrefs (if tool connected) or Google Autosuggest and categorize by intent."
*   **Interlinking:** "Scan my blog post at [url] and suggest 5 internal links from my sitemap."
