# David Ondrej OpenClaw Analysis

David Ondrej focuses on **practical AI applications** and **business automation** for non-engineers.

## Key Insights

### 1. The "Agency" Model
David often frames tools like OpenClaw as "Employees in a Box".
*   **Insight:** Treat OpenClaw as a "Junior Developer" or "Junior Marketer".
*   **Tip:** Be extremely specific in your system prompt. Don't just say "You are an assistant". Say "You are a Senior SEO Specialist with 10 years of experience. You prefer concise reports and bullet points."

### 2. Comparison to AutoGPT / BabyAGI
David has covered the evolution of agents extensively.
*   **Why OpenClaw?** It is more stable and "productized" than the experimental AutoGPT. It has a working CLI and mobile integration (WhatsApp/Telegram), which makes it usable *now* vs. "someday".

### 3. The "90% Automation" (Video Insight)
Referring to the concept of automating 90% of a workflow:
*   **Strategy:** Don't try to automate the *final decision*.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  OpenClaw gathers data.
    2.  OpenClaw drafts the content/email.
    3.  **Human (You)** reviews and hits "Send".
    4.  **Result:** 90% of the time is saved, but you keep 100% of the quality control.
*   **Setup:** Configure OpenClaw to "Draft" messages in Gmail rather than "Send" them.

## Setup Recommendations
*   **Platform:** Replit (for quick testing) or Vercel (if applicable), though he acknowledges the need for VPS for 24/7.
*   **Focus:** UI/UX interaction. He prefers agents that can "see" (using vision models) to interact with websites that don't have APIs.
